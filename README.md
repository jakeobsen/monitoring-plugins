# Munin plugins

This is my collection of munin plugins that i use for various things both at work and at home.

## temprager.py

This plugin was specifically written to extract temperature data from the AVTECH TemPageR 4E running firmware v2.6.0. I have no idea if it works with later version of the firmware the other products AVTECH makes. Use it at your own risk.
